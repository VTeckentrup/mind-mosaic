# Getting the Influenca binaries
In order to download Influenca, you can either clone the master branch of this repository or download the respective binary for your operating system (available for Windows, Mac OS, Linux & Android) from the root of the repository.
Please note that you need an active internet connection to register a user account when starting Influenca for the first time.

# Getting the Influenca source files
The folder src contains the Haxe/OpenFL source files. The assets folder contains the games graphic files and font as well as the icon.

# Customizing the code
If you want to play with the code yourself, you can of course open and customize the code with your favorite text editor though I would recommend to use an editor that supports Haxe with e.g. syntax highlighting. The code was created and tested using FlashDevelop on Windows, so you can also import the project with FlashDevelop using the included hxproj file.
