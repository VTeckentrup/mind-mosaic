# Getting the App files
In order to get the App, you can clone the master branch of this GitHub repository or download it as a zip file via the green "Clone or download" button in the upper right corner on the start page of this repository.

# Starting the App
Change to the folder you downloaded the App files into and unzip them if you fetched a zip file. Then go to the folder App -> bin -> html5 -> bin
and open the file "index.html" with your favorite browser.
You can select one of the slot machines by using your left and right arrow keys and log your selection by pressing the enter key.

# Customizing the code
If you want to play with the code yourself, you can of course open and customize the code with your favorite text editor though I would recommend to use an editor that supports Haxe with e.g. syntax highlighting. The code was created and tested using FlashDevelop on Windows, so you can also import the project with FlashDevelop using the included hxproj file.
