# Getting the App
In order to get the App, there are two ways, depending on if you just want to play the game or also get the source files. Please keep in mind that currently the App only comprises german language support.

I just want to play the game:
In this case you just need to download the Influenca.zip archive, visible in the list above.

I also want to have the source files:
In this case you can clone the master branch of this GitHub repository or download it as a zip file via the green "Clone or download" button in the upper right corner on the start page of this repository.

# Starting the App
Change to the folder you downloaded the App files into and unzip them if you fetched a zip file. 
If you downloaded the Influence.zip only and already extracted the archive, just enter the folder and run "Influenca.exe".

If you got the whole set of files from GitHub, go to the folder App -> bin -> neko -> bin and run "Influenca.exe" from this folder. 

Instructions on how to play the game are available in-app if you click on "Anleitung".

# Customizing the code
If you want to play with the code yourself, you can of course open and customize the code with your favorite text editor though I would recommend to use an editor that supports Haxe with e.g. syntax highlighting. The code was created and tested using FlashDevelop on Windows, so you can also import the project with FlashDevelop using the included hxproj file.
