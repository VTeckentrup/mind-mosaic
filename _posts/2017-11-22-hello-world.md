This blog is part of the project [Towards a bigger picture - Crowdsourcing the mosaic of the mind](https://de.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Fellow-Programm_Freies_Wissen/Einreichungen/Towards_a_bigger_picture_-_Crowdsourcing_the_mosaic_of_the_mind) within the [Open Science Fellowship 2017/2018](https://de.wikiversity.org/wiki/Wikiversity:Fellow-Programm_Freies_Wissen) by Wikimedia, Stifterverband and Volkswagenstiftung. 

In the following months you will find regular updates regarding the development process in the project that mostly focus on programming issues, theoretical background regarding mental health and the paradigms used as well as open science related practices and my experiences in incorporating them into my work.

I am always happy to receive comments, so in case you want to contact me, you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/glassybrain) or send a mail to the address detailed in the sidebar. I hope you have a pleasant stay and find some insightful posts on open science approaches applied to the psychiatric context!
